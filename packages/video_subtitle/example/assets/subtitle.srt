1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,710
- Hello, I'm Ncuti, and I play Eric.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,670
- Hi, I'm Emma, and I play Maeve.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,050
- And I'm Asa.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,130
I play Otis.

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,970
And we are about to take a quiz

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,361
to find out which Sex
Education character we are.

7
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:15,944
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,160
- First, how would your BFFs describe you?

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,160
- [Emma] Smart, creative,
funny, impulsive, bold, honest.

10
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:28,960
What'd you say?
- You I would describe

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,390
as funny, smart, and one of them.

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,347
- Funny, smart, creative,
okay, all of them, yeah.

13
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:36,240
- Shoot, I would say, but
you're a bit of everything.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,073
- Bold.

15
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:37,972
- You're bold.

16
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:38,805
- Because bold means everything.

17
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,638
- You're funny.

18
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,471
- It's a Libra thing.

19
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,304
- I think you gotta be
hissing the air, bold.

20
00:00:41,304 --> 00:00:42,227
You're bold.

21
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:43,060
- Bold.

22
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,910
Okay, bold.

23
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,260
(laughing)

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,093
- Bold.

25
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:46,986
You're...

26
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:48,103
- I don't know.

27
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:49,256
- I would say you're impulsive.

28
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,089
- Am I creative or impulsive?

29
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,481
Am I impulsive?
- Are you impulsive?

30
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,600
- I feel like you are.

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,433
- Sometimes.

32
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:55,266
- You're an Aries.

33
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,099
- But you're also very smart.

34
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:56,932
Ah, this is very hard.

35
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,320
This is question one, and we're like,

36
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,153
- I know.

37
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:00,424
- "Which option am I really?"

38
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,072
How would you describe me?

39
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:02,905
- I know.

40
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:03,738
Who am I?

41
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:04,571
- Honest?

42
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,404
- Emma, say, "Smart."

43
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:06,237
- Honest?

44
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:07,070
- Are you honest?

45
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,903
- I could be more honest.
- Are you lying to me?

46
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:08,736
Fine.

47
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,140
Choose a class to attend.

48
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,213
How to take a great #Selfie.

49
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,290
(laughing)

50
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,123
The art of cooking.

51
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:15,650
The science of Harry Potter.

52
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,150
Feminist literature 101.

53
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,282
Lego robotics.

54
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,600
(laughing)

55
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,930
And sex education.

56
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,160
- I'm gonna say...

57
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,088
- Lego robotics.

58
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:24,610
- The art of cooking.

59
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,880
- Oh, okay fine.

60
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,713
- Oh, why?

61
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:27,674
- No, that's fine.

62
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:30,730
- He already knows how
to take a great selfie.

63
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,620
- I don't need to go to class for that.

64
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,710
- He is the teacher.

65
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,220
- I'm the professor.

66
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,931
I might do the science of
Harry Potter, you know.

67
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,764
- That's what I!

68
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,720
(laughing)

69
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,696
I'm between those two.

70
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:40,529
No, I'm good.

71
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:42,730
I'm just gonna do science of Harry Potter.

72
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,563
- Okay, fun.

73
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:44,830
- 'cause I can cook quite well.

74
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,826
Not to brag.

75
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:47,840
- Lego robotics.

76
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,457
Pick a place at school to
make-out with your crush.

77
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:51,626
- Ooh, I like this one!

78
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:52,459
- The bathroom.

79
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,274
- [Emma] The library.

80
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:55,107
- [Asa] The empty classroom.

81
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,040
- [Emma] Sorry.

82
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,080
- [Asa] The cafeteria.

83
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,130
Or the locker room.

84
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,080
- The library.

85
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,150
- Oh, it's gotta be locker room.

86
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,250
Are you mad?

87
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,230
- But like it's a corridor, though,

88
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,627
it's quite daunting.

89
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,777
- [Asa] Library is
quite sort of secretive.

90
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,228
- [Emma] The playgrounds quite sweet,

91
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,740
but the library's is hot.

92
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,023
Everyone loves a little
cheeky library snogging.

93
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:15,640
(laughing)

94
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,399
it's very unhygienic.

95
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,040
- But they clean every day.

96
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,070
- Wait, all they said was make out.

97
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,320
- It's not sex.

98
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:24,617
Jesus.

99
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,210
- I'm gonna do empty classroom.

100
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,140
- Pick something to eat
at the school's cafeteria.

101
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,489
- [Asa] Pizza, salad,
peanut butter sandwich,

102
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,950
chicken nuggets, fruit
salad, or a milkshake.

103
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,033
- I wouldn't trust anything
in a school cafeteria.

104
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,700
- I'm gonna do fruit salad.

105
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,820
- I was gonna do... yeah fine.

106
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,020
We can both do the same.

107
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,263
- We can both do fruit salad.

108
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:50,820
- Milkshake or pizza.

109
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,808
- Milkshake or pizza.

110
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:53,085
- Milkshake or pizza.

111
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:54,830
(laughing)

112
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,663
- Milkshake.

113
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,293
- It's gonna be pizza because
you don't eat a milkshake.

114
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,353
And you wanna have some
food you wanna have like

115
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,188
- We don't like dairy.

116
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:03,245
We don't eat dairy.

117
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:04,430
- Exactly, we don't.

118
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,480
- Which character would
you trust with a secret?

119
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,480
- [Ncuti] Jackson, Lily,
Ola, Viv, Rahim, or Issac.

120
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,433
- Well, Jackson.

121
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,266
- Might be Lily.

122
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:14,413
- I'm gonna say...

123
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:15,940
- I'm gonna say Jackson.

124
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,170
- I'm gonna say Rahim.

125
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,700
- Did we all go for someone
that's not our character?

126
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,730
- Choose something important
from sex education.

127
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,700
Otis's sex clinic, Maeve's
essay prize trophy,

128
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,480
the Quiz Heads, Hedwig and the
Angry Inch, Lily's musical,

129
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,780
Moordale Secondary School.

130
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,062
That's a very tricky.

131
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:32,895
- What do you mean?

132
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,800
What does it mean choose
something important?

133
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,848
- They're all important.

134
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,706
- They're all.

135
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:38,750
I'm gonna say Otis's sex clinic.

136
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,350
- Instinctively I'm saying Quiz Heads,

137
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,370
because the font's bigger,
and I love the Quiz Heads.

138
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,710
- See, but I feel like a
lot of these things wouldn't

139
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,353
happen without Moordale.

140
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:51,590
- That's very true.

141
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,450
- Yeah that's true.

142
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,150
- See, he's wise as well.

143
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,715
- Wise, that should have been an option.

144
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:56,548
- That's what I was gonna say.

145
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:58,890
- So what, you mean as in
Moordale Secondary School?

146
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,898
- I've picked.

147
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:00,731
I pick Moordale.

148
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:02,783
- And I love them, I do love them as well,

149
00:04:02,783 --> 00:04:03,616
and I'm gonna pick Quiz Heads.

150
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,260
- I'm gonna pick Otis's sex clinic,

151
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,630
just because I think you
have such wise words.

152
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,710
Finally, pick something
to binge watch on Netflix.

153
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,130
- [Ncuti] Schitt's Creek,
The End of the F**ing World,

154
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,950
Atypical, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,

155
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,783
Strangest...

156
00:04:19,974 --> 00:04:21,557
- Strangest Things.

157
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,060
- Stranger Things.

158
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,310
(laughing)

159
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,999
- Grace and Frankie.

160
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:31,174
- Do you know what?

161
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:32,007
I haven't watched the second season

162
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,158
of End of the F**ing World.

163
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,480
- No, I haven't seen the second season.

164
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,313
- I have watched...

165
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:38,342
- I haven't seen a few of these.

166
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,540
- We all binged Stranger Things.

167
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,537
- I've never seen...

168
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:43,075
- You haven't seen it.

169
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,295
- That's fine, that's fine.

170
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:45,470
- I haven't watched
the most recent season.

171
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,611
- I'm gonna say Sabrina
because I like witchy stuff.

172
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,845
(Gasps)

173
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:52,918
- I didn't say that.

174
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,874
- Sorry.

175
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,370
- Um, I'm gonna pick Stranger
Things because I just

176
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,668
need to get...

177
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:58,109
(yelling)

178
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,387
- Oh my God.

179
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,637
(laughing)

180
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,510
- That makes me so,

181
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,670
they make me these...

182
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,503
Okay.

183
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:13,430
- What the hell?

184
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,210
- Which character did you get?

185
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,423
- I got Eric Effiong.

186
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,980
Your personality matches
Eric, you're outgoing,

187
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,770
sincere, and passionate,
like Eric you march to

188
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,300
the beat of your own drum.

189
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,720
You don't care what other people think.

190
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
Your friends often turn to you

191
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,817
if they want to have a good time.

192
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,102
- Aw!

193
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,107
It's true.

194
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,440
- It's so true.

195
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,193
- I got Aimee Gibbs.

196
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,890
Your personality matches Aimee.

197
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,100
You're charismatic, bold, and fierce.

198
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,910
Like Aimee, you're extremely confident,

199
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,550
while some people might
consider you popular,

200
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,810
you'd much rather have a
quiet night in with your BFFs

201
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,860
than hang at a party.

202
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,250
You'll do anything to help your friends.

203
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,382
- Yes!

204
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:52,215
That's very true.

205
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,130
- Wow.

206
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,460
This is incredibly accurate, so far.

207
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,166
I got Adam Groff.

208
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,031
- Two coke cans.

209
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,678
(laughing)

210
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,110
- Your personality matches Adam.

211
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,491
You're impulsive,
assertive, and enthusiastic.

212
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,760
Like Adam, you're still
trying to find out your place

213
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,480
in this world, whilst you're
often seen as intimidating,

214
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,520
deep down you're incredibly sweet.

215
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,800
- The least intimidating person.

216
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,633
- What do you mean?

217
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,628
- What do you mean?

218
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,000
(laughing)

219
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,200
- Aw, I enjoyed that.

220
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,608
I'm so glad I got Aimee.

221
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,441
- Yeah.

222
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,274
- That's lovely.

223
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:27,888
And I would rather have a
quiet night in, actually.

224
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:28,721
- Yeah.

225
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,290
- And I'll do anything
for you two, I will.

226
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,683
- Well, hope you enjoyed
that quiz, we sure did.

227
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:37,320
(laughing)

228
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,000
If you wanna take it, check out Buzzfeed,

229
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,250
it's on there, and watch
Sex Education season two,

230
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,434
it's on Netflix now.

231
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,267
- Yeah!

232
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,540
Watch it!

233
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,421
- Watch it.

234
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,522
- [All] Bye!

235
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,189
(upbeat music)
