## Description

Interface for working with analytic services.  
The library is supposed to unify work with various analytic services. The main actors are:

* **AnalyticAction** — any action that is valuable for analytics. Usually it is a "button pressed" or "screen opened" type of event but the main criterion is a possibility to be handled by `AnalyticActionPerformer`.
* **AnalyticActionPerformer** — a performer of specific actions used to incapsulate work with a certain analytics service. Typically implemented by transforming `AnalyticAction` into a required format as well as calling *send()* of a third-party library.
* **AnalyticService** — a unified entry point for several `AnalyticActionPerformer`s.

## Example

The easiest interaction with the library is as follows:

1. Determine the actions that ought to be recorded in the analytics service:

    ```dart
    class MyAnalyticAction implements AnalyticAction {
        final String key;
        final String value;

        MyAnalyticAction(this.key, this.value);
    }

    class ButtonPressedAction extends MyAnalyticAction {
        ButtonPressedAction() : super("button_pressed", null);
    }

    class ScreenOpenedAction extends MyAnalyticAction {
        ScreenOpenedAction({String param}) : super("screen_opened", param);
    }
    ```

2. Implement action performer:

    ```dart
    class MyAnalyticActionPerformer
        implements AnalyticActionPerformer<MyAnalyticAction> {
        final SomeAnalyticService _service;

        MyAnalyticActionPerformer(this._service);

        @override
        bool canHandle(AnalyticAction action) => action is MyAnalyticAction;

        @override
        void perform(MyAnalyticAction action) {
            _service.send(action.key, action.value);
        }
    }
    ```

3. Add performer to the service:

```dart
    final analyticService = DefaultAnalyticService();
    analyticService.addActionPerformer(
        MyAnalyticActionPerformer(SomeAnalyticService()),
    );
```

Usage:

```dart
    analyticService.performAction(ButtonPressedAction());
```
