## About

This package helps retrieve the current positioning coordinates of any widget in a widgets tree in your Flutter application.

## Currently supported features

- Retrieve the full set of positioning coordinates of the desired widget at any time;
- Calculate the difference in positioning between two widgets and use it the way you need.

## Usage

### Getting widget's coordinates

Instantiate `RenderParametersManager` object. You can set a special type for the widget's unique identifier or leave it `dynamic`.

```dart
final renderManager = RenderParametersManager<dynamic>();
```

Wrap the desired widget in a `RenderMetricsObject`. The `id` parameter is the widget’s unique identifier.

```dart
RenderMetricsObject(
    id: "uniqueWidgetId",
    manager: renderManager,
    child: Container(
        ...
    ),
),
```

Get a bundle with the positioning coordinates of the wrapped widget.

```dart
RenderData data = renderManager.getRenderData("uniqueWidgetId");
```

### Calculating the difference in positioning between two widgets

Wrap the widgets you want to compare in `RenderMetricsObject`s. Specify two different `id`s for each of them. Please note, that the `manager` parameter of both widgets should contain the link to the same `RenderParametersManager` instance.

```dart
RenderMetricsObject(
    id: "rowWidgetId",
    manager: renderManager,
    child: Row(
        ...
    ),
),
RenderMetricsObject(
    id: "columnWidgetId",
    manager: renderManager,
    child: Column(
        ...
    ),
),
```

Specify two unique widget identifiers when using the `getDiffById()` function and extract a bundle with the relative difference in positioning coordinates between the widgets.

```dart
ComparisonDiff diff =
    renderManager.getDiffById("rowWidgetId", "columnWidgetId");
```

## What metrics can I get?

### RenderData

`RenderData` instance contains a complete set of properties that characterize any widget in a two-dimensional space.

All metrics positioning coordinates are global, meaning they are relative to the entire screen coordinate space.

`RenderData` also provides you an ability to get all widget keypoint XY-coordinates by calling one of special getters.

### ComparisonDiff

You can get the comparison relative results for each widget keypoint from the `ComparisonDiff` instance.

An additional set of special getters can help you calculate the difference between two adjacent sides of two different widgets (e.g. right to left, top to bottom, etc.).
