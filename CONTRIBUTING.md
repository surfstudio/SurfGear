## How to update package

All packages uses [semver](https://semver.org/) form for maintaining versions.

Meaning that, versions contains 3 numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

For example, you'd like to create a patch, that doesn't break backward compatibility.

1. Create branch from `main` with name describing patch update.
2. Make some package updates.
3. Update package `Changelog` file with following lines:

    ``` markdown
    ## PATCH

    * short summary of proposed changes

    ```

4. Create PR and add reviewer.

When reviewer accepts your PR, and merge it into `main` branch, [GH Actions script](https://github.com/surfstudio/SurfGear/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_to_pub.yaml) will analyse `Changelog` file for MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH tag. Selecting the highest severity of changes updates the corresponding digit in the package version, then cleans the semver tags from the changelog and publishes the package.

Note that you don't need to update version in pubspec.yaml. The script does it for you.

So, your `Changelog` updates will be replaced with

``` markdown
## latest-stable-version-dev.xx

* short summary of proposed changes (PATCH â€¦ )

```
